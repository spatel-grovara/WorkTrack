2025-04-28T02:37:53.18014928Z (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
2025-04-28T02:37:53.18015237Z - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
2025-04-28T02:37:53.18015557Z - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
2025-04-28T02:37:53.180170391Z - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
